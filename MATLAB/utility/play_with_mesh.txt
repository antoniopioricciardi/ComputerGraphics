scatterplot: https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter3.html



plot options:
shading interp - interpolate colours (good for scalar functions)
shading flat - do not interpolate (good for segmentations)
shading faceted - flat with visible mesh edges

// shape appearance is affected by lights and how the surface reacts to them
no light/light
light .... light - add more illumination
lighting gouraud - interpolates linearly across the triangles

Ambient light - mainly affects shadows (with trisurf 'AmbientStrength' value in [0,1])
Diffuse Reflection - mainly affects color brillance (with trisurf 'DiffuseStrength' in [0,1])
Specular reflection - directly affects specularities (with trisurf 'SpecularStrength' in [0,1])
** always remember to turn lights on first! **
camlight - places the light in front of the camera
